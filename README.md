## üí° How It Works

1. **Temperature and Smoke Detection**: The system uses the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and the MQ2 sensor to detect smoke levels.
2. **Alert Mechanism**:
   - If smoke levels or temperature exceed specified thresholds, the red LED and buzzer activate.
   - The water pump is powered on intermittently to spray water and reduce fire risk.
   - An SMS alert is sent to a specified number via the SIM800L module.
3. **LCD Display**: The LCD shows the current system status and displays temperature and smoke levels.
4. **Relay Control**: The relays are used to control the water pump and additional motor for potential fire extinguishing actions.
